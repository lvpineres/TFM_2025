Data retrive from work Liu, S. et al. (2023). Breast adipose tissue-derived extracellular
vesicles from obese women alter tumor cell metabolism.  DOI 10.15252/embr.202357339.

We preprocessed the data in order perform different goals, in this repository you can
find the first steps that include (Log2 transformation, imputation, scaling, dimensionality reduction and labeling)


We aim to analyze DDA proteomic data derived extracellular vesicules from breast adipose
tissue from obese and overweigth women in New York. This work implement different 
approach to select the better hyperparamenters in every technique, you can find a summarization
in the figure 1 and the algorithms steps for the selected parameters.
